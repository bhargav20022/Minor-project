## 📌 About the Project

**Wanderlust** is a production-style full-stack web application where property owners (hosts) can list their homes, villas, and stays — and travellers can discover, book, and pay for them online.

Built entirely from scratch as a college minor project, it covers everything a real-world booking platform needs: authentication, image uploads, interactive maps, payment processing, admin controls, automated emails, and more.

## ✨ Features

### 👤 User System
- Register, login, logout with secure session-based authentication (Passport.js)
- Role-based access: **Guest**, **Host**, and **Admin**
- OTP-based forgot password / reset password flow via email
- Persistent sessions stored in MongoDB Atlas (connect-mongo)

### 🏠 Listings
- Hosts can **create, edit, and delete** property listings
- Image upload via **Cloudinary CDN** (Multer + multer-storage-cloudinary)
- Each listing includes: title, description, price per night, location, country, category, and photo
- All new listings go through **admin approval** before going live (pending → approved/rejected)

### 🗺️ Interactive Maps
- Each listing page shows a live **Mapbox map** with the exact location pinned
- Location is auto-geocoded using the **Mapbox Geocoding SDK** on create/update

### 📅 Booking System
- Guests can select **check-in date, check-out date, and number of guests**
- Total price is automatically calculated based on nights × price per night
- Booking data stored in MongoDB with full status tracking: `Pending → Paid → Cancelled`

### 💳 Payment Flow
- Dedicated payment page after booking confirmation
- On successful payment: booking status updates to **Paid**, unique Payment ID generated
- Styled **HTML confirmation email** sent to guest via Brevo API

### 📧 Automated Email Notifications
| Trigger | Recipient | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Booking confirmed | Guest | Full booking summary with dates, amount, property image |
| Listing approved | Host | Approval confirmation from admin |
| Listing rejected | Host | Rejection with reason |
| Checkout day | Guest | Automated reminder sent at 8 AM daily |

Emails built with styled HTML templates and sent via **Brevo (Sendinblue) Transactional Email API**.

### 🛡️ Admin Dashboard
- View all **pending, approved, and rejected** listings
- **Approve or reject** listings with custom rejection reason
- View all **registered users** and platform complaints
- Dashboard stats: total listings, total users, open complaints, pending approvals

### ⭐ Reviews & Ratings
- Guests can leave star ratings and text reviews on any listing
- Reviews are author-linked (only review author can delete their review)
- Owner cannot review their own listing (enforced via authorization middleware)

### 📋 Host Dashboard
- Hosts can see all bookings received across their listings
- Revenue tracking: total revenue, active bookings, listing count

### 📋 Guest Booking History

## ⚙️ Architecture

Built using the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern:

```
Request → Route → Middleware (auth/validation) → Controller → Model → View → Response
```

- **Models** — Mongoose schemas define data structure and relationships
- **Views** — EJS templates render dynamic HTML (with EJS-Mate for shared layouts)
- **Controllers** — Business logic separated cleanly from routes
- **Middleware** — Reusable guards: `isLoggedIn`, `isOwner`, `isAdmin`, `validateListing`
